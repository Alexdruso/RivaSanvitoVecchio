\subsection{Class diagram}

A UML class diagram describing the main entities involved in the system follows.
Customers use the system to line up in the queue of a store and obtain a line up
receipt that will grant them a visit to the store. Each store belongs to a given
chain of stores. Moreover, each store can be internally divided in departments,
containing different categories of purchasable items. When the customers line
up, they can specify the categories of items they intend to buy. Finally, the
system knows the locations of the customers and of the stores.
