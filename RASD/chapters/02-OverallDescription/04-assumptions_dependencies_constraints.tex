\subsection{Constraints}

In order to improve the ease of use of the system, customers won't authenticate to the system. For all the functionalities that require to know the identity of the customers, the system will use:
- when customers access the system with an IT device, a device identifier that the system generates and binds to the device itself
- when customers access the system with a standard telephone line, the caller identifier of the telephone line (telephone number)

For the authentication of store personnel (i.e., store assistants and store managers), instead, the system will integrate with the stores' identity systems.
