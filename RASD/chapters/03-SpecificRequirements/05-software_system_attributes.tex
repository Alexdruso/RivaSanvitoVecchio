	\subsection{Reliability}

	CLup's queueing system is critical in order to keep track of the accesses, thus its infrastructure 
	should be characterized by the highest MTTF and lowest MTTR possible.

	A larger MTTR is acceptable for the other services, however it's mandatory to ensure the lack of 
	data losses during downtime.

	\subsection{Availability}

	All services must be up and running 24/7, both supermarkets and users need to be notified in case of 
	any communication issues with CLup servers.

	Stores should be able to communicate with CLup's servers during all their opening time span.

	As shown in the following histogram, it is expected an high utilisation of all services during the day, 
	and a low usage during night hours.
