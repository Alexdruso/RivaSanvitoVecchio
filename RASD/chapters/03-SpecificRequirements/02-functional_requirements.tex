    \subsection{Alternative suggestion}

    Luca lives in a country where lockdown policies are applied. The last time he shopped for groceries online, 
    he forgot to add to the cart olive oil, and now he needs it. Waiting until the next delivery would take too much time, 
    so Luca decides to line up for the nearest store. 
    Luca opens CLup, looks for the nearest store and selects it. 
    He then inserts the expected duration of his visit and the category of the item he wants to buy. 
    Unfortunately, CLup estimates that the olive oil department will be busy for the next hours. 
    CLup suggests an alternative store in proximity, where there is a free slot sooner. 
    Luca accepts the suggestion and CLup queues Luca to access the store. Luca receives confirmation.

    \subsection{Visit time and place estimation}

    Anna, a long time customer of the local store, wants to reserve a time slot to go grocery shopping the next week. 
    Anna opens CLup and selects the desired store and the desired date and time slot. 
    Not knowing yet which articles she might need, she does not fill the product categories section, 
    and she does not provide any visit duration estimation. Once Anna confirms her intentions to CLup, 
    the system predicts automatically the duration and the departments she is most likely to be in, 
    based on the collected history of previous visits. CLup then checks if Anna's visit is compatible with the 
    current schedule of the store, and, as the answer is positive, it shows a confirmation of the reservation to Anna.

    \subsection{Cancellation}

    Maurizio reserved a slot in the queue to access the nearby store through CLup, but, due to an unforeseen commitment, 
    he has to cancel the appointment. Maurizio opens CLup, selects the reservation and cancels it. 
    The system removes Maurizio from the queue and sends a confirmation to the customer. 
    Meanwhile, Patrizia wanted to access the store as soon as possible, but all the nearest time slots were busy, 
    and the system delayed her reservation. CLup, aware of the recently freed time slot, sends a notification to Patrizia offering her to take it over. 
    Patrizia opens CLup, accepts the offering and CLup queues her in the time slot.

    \subsection{Access to the store}

    Alina is in line through CLup to access a store and her visit start time is near. 
    CLup sends a notification to Alina to remind her of the visit. 
    Alina departs from her home and approaches the store, showing the receipt on her IT device to the receipt scanner. 
    CLup checks if the customer arrived either too early or too late with respect to the assigned time slot. 
    Alina is perfectly in time and is allowed to enter the store. Finally, when the visit is coming to an end, 
    Alina's receipt is shown once again at the store cashier, who scans it. 
    CLup registers the end of the visit and sends a confirmation message to the cashier.

    \subsection{In presence queueing}

    Alessandro, a nurse, would like to stop at the store on the way home from work to do some urgent grocery shopping. 
    Unfortunately, Alessandro's smartphone is out of charge, and he cannot use CLup's application. 
    Alessandro stops at the store anyway, approaches the store assistant at the entrance, and asks for a receipt. 
    The store assistant accesses CLup and requests to queue a visitor. The system adds the customer to the queue and sends the line up receipt as a confirmation. 
    The store assistant prints the line up receipt and gives it to Alessandro, who waits his turn.

    \subsection{Queueing via telephone}

    Andrea does not own either a smartphone or a personal computer. 
    Andrea would want to queue up immediately to go grocery shopping in a store adopting the CLup system, 
    but, as he is missing any IT device, he can not access the system through the Internet. 
    Andrea calls CLup's number, and the system guides him through the process: first of all, 
    the synthesized voice asks Andrea if he would like to access the store as soon as possible or to reserve a time slot, 
    and then the store he would like to visit. Once Andrea has answered the questions and confirmed his intentions, 
    the system adds Andrea to the queue of the store. The system then dictates the numeric number to be used at the entrance of the store. 
    Once Andrea confirms that he has understood the code, the interaction is closed.

    \subsection{Reservation via telephone}

    This time, Andrea would want to reserve a time slot to go grocery shopping next week. 
    Andrea calls CLup's number and states, once asked, that he would like to use the reservation functionalities. 
    CLup asks Andrea, in sequence, which store he would like to access, at what date, and at which time. 
    The system repeats Andrea's choices and asks for confirmation. Once Andrea confirms, 
    the system estimates the visit duration and checks if it is compatible with the current schedule. 
    The system then dictates the numeric number to be used at the entrance of the store. 
    Once Andrea confirms that he has understood the code, the interaction is closed.
