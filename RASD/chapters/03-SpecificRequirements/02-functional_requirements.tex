    \subsection*{Alternative suggestion}

    Carlo lives in a country where lockdown policies are applied. The last time he shopped for groceries online, 
    he forgot to add to the cart olive oil, and now he needs it. Waiting until the next delivery would take too much time, 
    so Carlo decides to line up for the nearest store. 
    Carlo opens CLup, looks for the nearest store and selects it. 
    He then inserts the expected duration of his visit and the category of the item he wants to buy. 
    Unfortunately, CLup estimates that the olive oil department will be busy for the next hours. 
    CLup suggests an alternative store in proximity, where there is a free slot sooner. 
    Carlo accepts the suggestion and CLup queues Carlo to access the store. Carlo receives confirmation.

    \subsection*{Visit time estimation}

    Anna, a long time customer of the local store, wants to reserve a time slot to go grocery shopping the next week. 
    Anna opens CLup and selects the desired store and the desired date and time slot. 
    Not knowing yet which articles she might need, she does not fill the product categories section, 
    and she does not provide any visit duration estimation. Once Anna confirms her intentions to CLup, 
    the system predicts automatically the duration and the departments she is most likely to be in, 
    based on the collected history of previous visits. CLup then checks if Anna's visit is compatible with the 
    current schedule of the store, and, as the answer is positive, it shows a confirmation of the reservation to Anna.
