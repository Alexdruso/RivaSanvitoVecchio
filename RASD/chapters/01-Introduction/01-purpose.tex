During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has proven to be a valuable tool to reduce the diffusion of the virus among the population. To enforce this kind of behaviour,
governments around the world adopted strict lockdown policies, allowing people out of their homes only to carry out essential tasks.
Grocery shopping has proven to be a challenging situation to regulate, due to the need for both restricting access to the shops and 
avoiding the formation of crowded queues outside of them.

To maximize the accesses to the store while preserving a safe environment and to ease visit planning, the store customer should be provided with a way to express preferences for a time slot 
and to indicate the approximate duration of his visit.
Moreover, the accesses across different stores and day or time ranges should be balanced by proactively suggesting possible alternatives.
Overall, each process should be easy to use to include all demographics.

The goal of the following document is to provide a comprehensive description of requirements and specification for the software-to-be under analysis. 
Relevant use cases and models will be addressed through the use of natural language, UML, and Alloy. 
Choices made regarding the interpretation, the problem under analysis and the related software-to-be will be clearly stated by the creators of this document, along with their rationale.
