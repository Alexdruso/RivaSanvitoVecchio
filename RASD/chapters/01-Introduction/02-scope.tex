\subsection{Product}

CLup is a system that allows to handle access to supermarkets when the flux of
people is restricted. In particular, it allows customers to line-up remotely
(i.e., without being physically in a line outside the supermarket) and suggests
them the right time to go to the supermarket without having to form a queue
outside.

CLup allows customers either to request access to the supermarket as soon as
possible, or to book in advance an access to the supermarket at a given slot of
date and time. In both cases, the system aims at preventing overcrowding in each
area of the building. Access to the supermarket is granted only when using the
system so that CLup can actively monitor the number of people inside the
building.

Customers will be allowed to enter the store from the time they chose when requesting to line up, but no later than a centrally determined delay after the chosen time, after which their line up request will expire.

If many people are in a queue for the same access slot, CLup gives the customers
possible alternatives about slots or supermarket that are less crowded.
Moreover, upon customer request, it can proactively inform them if there are
available slots in a given day or time range.

The main interface between CLup and the user is assumed to be an IT device with
an Internet connection. However, since not all people may have access to such
technologies, the system can be used, with limited functionalities, just through
a standard telephone line or in presence.

The system is completed by an administrational dashboard that allows store
managers to monitor the accesses to the supermarkets in real-time and to manage
the queuing parameters, such as the maximum number of people allowed in the
building at the same time.
