\section{Product}

CLup is a system that allows to handle access to supermarkets when the flux of
people is restricted. Handling properly such a situation is very important due
to the currently active Coronavirus pandemic: grocery shopping can't be avoided
since it is one of the most essential needs, thus access to supermarket cannot
be prevented, but it must be regulated to prevent overcrowding.

In particular, CLup allows customers who need to go grocery shopping to line-up
remotely (i.e., without being physically in a line outside the supermarket) and
suggests them the right time to go to the supermarket without having to wait
outside.

CLup allows customers either to request access to the supermarket as soon as
possible, or to book in advance an access to the supermarket at a given slot of
date and time. In both cases, the system aims at preventing overcrowding in each
area of the building. Access to the supermarket is granted only when using the
system so that CLup can actively monitor the number of people inside the
building.

If many people are in a queue for the same access slot, CLup gives the customers
possible alternatives about slots or supermarket that are less crowded.
Moreover, upon customer request, it can proactively inform them if there are
available slots in a given day or time range.

The main interactions between CLup and the customers are mediated by an IT
device with an Internet connection. However, since not all people may have
access to such technologies, the system can be used, with limited
functionalities, just through a standard telephone line or in presence.

The system is completed by an administrational dashboard that allows store
managers to monitor the accesses to the supermarkets in real-time and to manage
the queuing parameters, such as the maximum number of people allowed in the
building at the same time.

\section{World and Shared phenomena}

\subsection{World phenomena}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The customer needs to go grocery shopping
  \item The customer arrives at the supermarket
  \item The customer leaves the supermarket
  \item The local authority asks the store manager to report how many people are
  inside the building
  \item The local authority asks the store manager to modify the masimum number
  of people allowed inside the building
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Shared phenomena - controlled by the World}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The customer asks the system to line up and enter the supermarket as
  soon as possible through an IT device
  \item The customer asks the system to book an entrance at the supermarket at a
  given date and time through an IT device
  \item The customer asks the system to line up and enter the supermarket as
  soon as possible through a standard telephone line
  \item The customer asks the system to book an entrance at the supermarket at a
  given date and time through a standard telephone line
  \item The customer asks the system to line up and enter the supermarket as
  soon as possible with an on-site device
  \item The customer asks the system to print the receipt of a request made by
  telephone with an on-site device
  \item The customer informs the system on the estimated duration of the visit
  to the supermarket
  \item The customer informs the system on the categories of products they
  intend to buy
  \item The customer scans the QR code receipt at the entrance of the
  supermarket
  \item The customer scans the QR code receipt at the exit of the supermarket
  \item The store manager queries the system for the number of people inside the
  building
  \item The store manager informs the system on the maximum number of people
  allowed inside the building
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Shared phenomena - controlled by the Machine}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system shows the user a QR code as a receipt of a request performed
  through an IT device
  \item The system prints through an on-site device a QR code as a receipt of a
  request performed through a standard telephone line
  \item The system prints through an on-site device a QR code as a receipt of a
  request performed through the on-site device itself
  \item The system informs the customer that it's time to go to the supermarket
  to take advantage of the requested slot
  \item The system allows a customer to enter the supermarket
  \item The system gives the customer suggestions on less crowded slots or
  supermarkets
  \item The system informs the customer that a specific time slot in a range
  they chose in advance is available
\end{enumerate}
