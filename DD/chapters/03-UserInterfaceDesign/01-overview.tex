The mockups of the graphical user interfaces to interact with CLup using an IT
device were presented in section 3.1.1 of the Requirements And Specification
Document. The graphical user interfaces will be translated in English and
Italian; the device settings will be used to determine the users' preferred
language. If the user preferred language is not available, English will be
chosen.

While store managers and store assistants only interact with the system through
IT devices, customers may interact with the system also using a standard
telephone line or in presence (through store assistants). The interactions with
the store assistants are human-to-human, so they are not described in this
document. The interactions through a telephone line, instead, are described in
the next paragraph, as a reference for the programmatic implementation that is
required.

\subsection{Customers interactions through a standard telephone line}

Interactions with the customers will be either initiated by the customers
themselves (e.g., to reserve their place in a queue) by calling CLup's telephone
number, or initiated by the system (e.g., to notify that it is time to leave to
reach the store in time for the expected entrance time) by calling the telephone
number the customers originally used to interact with the system. The customers
will be allowed to interact with the system using the language of their choice
between English and Italian. Different telephone numbers will be provided to the
users to let them choose their preferred language.

Voice recognition or DTMF tone recognition will be used to receive inputs from
the customers, while the system will use voice synthesis to reply.

Each store will be assigned a numeric identifier that can be used by the
customers to reference it.

As a receipt for their line up requests, customers will receive from the system
a numeric code that they will communicate before entering the store to the store
assistant, who will input in the store assistant application to print the QR
code that the customer will use to access the store.
