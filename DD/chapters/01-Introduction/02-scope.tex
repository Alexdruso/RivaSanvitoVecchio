CLup is a system that allows supermarkets' customers to line-up remotely
(i.e., without being physically in a line outside the supermarket) and to manage their access to the supermarkets to prevent overcrowding. The reasons behind these needs are described in details in the CLups' Requirements And Specification Document.

To be effective, CLup must be adopted by the greatest number of supermarkets possible, and be usable by the greatest number of customers possible. To reach such an objective, the scalability and the usability of the system are taken into account when defining:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the system architecture, which should scale well with the rate of adoption of the system;
  \item the user experience, which should be effective for people of all ages and conditions;
  \item the testing of all the system's components and of the system as a whole, to guarantee an adequate level of quality.
\end{itemize}
