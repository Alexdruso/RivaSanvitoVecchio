\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first chapter is an introduction and an overview of the project, setting the context leading to the design choices made in this document.

Moreover, this chapter describes how the components are to be deployed using well known architectural styles and patterns and detailing the motivations for each choice.

    \item The third chapter extends the "User interfaces" section described in the RASD by adding further details on how all the interactions with the users will be handled.
    
    \item The fourth chapter provides traceability information that allows to map the components described in this document with the requirements enumerated in the RASD.
    
    \item The fifth and last chapter provides the plans that should be adopted when implementing, integrating and testing the system.
