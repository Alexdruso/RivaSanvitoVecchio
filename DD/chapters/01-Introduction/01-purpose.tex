This document provides the functional description of CLup, a system that allows
handling access to supermarkets when the flux of people is restricted. Starting
from CLup's Requirements And Specification Document, the system architecture is
described, together with the design of the user interfaces. Each system
component is mapped to one or more requirements specified in the RASD document.
Finally, adequate plans to adopt when implementing, integrating and testing the
system are provided.
