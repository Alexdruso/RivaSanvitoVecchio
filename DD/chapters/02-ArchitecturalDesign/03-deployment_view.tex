The following diagram describes the deployment view of CLup. CLup's backend is deployed in a cloud platform, where elasticity is 
achieved by using autoscalers, which scale the instances count assigned to each tier based on the load measured in the load balancer
or in the queue. The CDN is here represented as an external service, which might be provided by the same cloud platform on which 
CLup's backend is deployed.
