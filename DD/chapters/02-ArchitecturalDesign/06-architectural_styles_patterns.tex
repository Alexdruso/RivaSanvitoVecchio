\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns}
    As already stated in the overview, the general architecture draws inspiration from the classical client-server architectural style, adapted in a multi-tiered cloud configuration.  This pattern is field-proven and offers enough space for future adjustments due to the separation of concerns fostered by the differentiation of tiers in a model, view, controller fashion.

    The architecture implements a publish/subscribe pattern to handle notifications to the clients, exploiting existing notification services. 
    The publish/subscribe pattern also collapses into a queue-based communication protocol to ensure the highest decoupling between the web server and the application server.

    Finally, the architecture implements private CDNs to distribute static content with the highest efficiency and performance.
