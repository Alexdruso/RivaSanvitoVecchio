The entire system, along with its relative sub-systems, has to be implemented, tested and integrated using a bottom-up approach. 
With this strategy, the system can be assembled in an incremental way so that the testing process can begin in parallel with the implementation. 
This approach allows for better robustness since the components are implemented, tested and validated in a hierarchical order, from bottom to top level.


The order of implementation should be:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item StoreManager
	\item ReceiptManager
	\item AccessManager
	\item StatisticsComputationManager
	\item LineUpSuggestionsManager
	\item LineUpRequestManager
	\item LineUpCancellationManager
	\item NotificationManager
	\item AuthenticationManager
	\item Web server (if it is chosen to implement it rather than using a pre-existing one)

\end{enumerate}
