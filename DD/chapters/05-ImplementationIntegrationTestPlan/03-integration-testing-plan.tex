\subsection{Overview}

Immediately after the implementation of a component, it should be unit tested; if needed, a driver can be used in place of the components that are not yet fully implemented. 
As a consequence of choosing a bottom-up approach in the implementation process, we should choose a bottom-up strategy also for integration and testing as well. 
After the unit tests of a component succeeds, it is integrated in the system and integration testing is performed: every interface that the component uses is tested. Since a bottom-up approach is used, this process ends when the components at the top of the hierarchy are integrated in the system.
At that point, the system as a whole can be tested with system tests.

\subsection{Plan}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item At first, the DBMS API has to be tested, in order to check for misconfiguration and correctness of the interface.

	\item Then, the implementation goes on for StoreManager, ReceiptManager, StatisticComputationManager, and LineUpSuggestionsManager. 
	
\item Then, AccessManager, LineUpCancellationManager, and LineUpRequestManager are integrated and tested.
	\item Later, the implementation of NotificationManager and its integration with Notification Service can begin. 

	\item Later, the implementation of AuthenticationManager and its integration with the Identity Provider can begin. 

	\item Then, after the deployment of the Web Server component, its integration in the whole system is tested.
	\item Finally, the Phone Call Serice and the TripTimeEstimation Service are integrated into the system. IT devices, telephones, and receipt scanners are used to interact with the completed system.

\end{enumerate}
