\subsection{Overview}

Following the implementation of each component, unit testing must be carried out, if needed using a driver for the components that are not yet fully implemented. 
As a consequence of choosing a bottom-up approach in the implementation process, we should choose a bottom-up strategy also for integration and testing. 
After the unit testing process, every interface between fully implemented and verified components has to be implemented. 
Finally, after the integration of each component, integration tests must be carried out, with a bottom-up approach. 

\subsection{Plan}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item At first, the DBMS API has to be tested, in order to check for misconfiguration and correctness of the interface.

	\item Then, the implementation goes on for StoreManager, ReceiptManager, AccessManager, StatisticComputationManager, LineUpRequestManager and LineUpSuggestionsManager. 
	After the verification of each component, ReceiptManagement and SuggestionManagement interfaces can be implemented and tested.

	\item Later, the implementation of NotificationManager and its integration with Notification Service can begin. 
	After the unit testing and integration phases, the Notification Service API has to be tested. 
	Following, the Phone Call Service API and Phone Call Service can be integrated into the system.

	\item Then, after the implementation and unit testing of AuthenticationManager and the integration of the Identity Provider service, we shall proceed with the integration testing the Verification API. 
	Following this step, Authentication API has to be tested. Since we do not implement this interface ourselves, instead relying on already existing standard interfaces, the testing process only involves the verification of the correct integration of OAuth API or SAML.

	\item After the deployment of the Web Server component, integration tests on the Web Server API and the whole Application Server API should be performed. 
	Finally, the TripTimeEstimationService and its relative Estimation API can be integrated into the system, and integration tests can be carried out. 

\end{enumerate}
